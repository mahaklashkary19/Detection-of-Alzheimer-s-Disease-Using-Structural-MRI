# Detection-of-Alzheimer-s-Disease-Using-Structural-MRI

**About the Project**  
In this project, I worked on detecting the progression of Alzheimer’s disease using brain MRI scans. The goal was to build a deep learning model that could assist in early diagnosis by identifying subtle changes in brain structure.

**What I Did**
- Used the **ConvMixer architecture** to build a model that classifies different stages of Alzheimer’s.
- Focused on improving accuracy and generalization by experimenting with model depth and patch size.
- Worked with **structural MRI data**, handling preprocessing, normalization, and visual interpretation of results.
- Compared performance with standard CNNs to show how ConvMixer boosts results in medical imaging tasks.
